/*
    Watson Elementary School contains 10 classrooms numbered 1 through 10.
   Each classroom can contain any number of students up to 12.
   Each student takes an achievement test at the end of the school year and receives a score from 0 through 100.
   Write a program that accepts data for each student in the schoolâ€”student ID, classroom number, and score on the achievement test.
   Design a program that lists the total points scored for each of the 10 classrooms.
